            <p>
                Migo allows students to barter and exchange goods or services for tutor assistance. Whether that is cash, food, or anything else, is between student and tutor.

            <h2>A worry-free experience.</h2>
            <p>
                Safety for both students and tutors is our highest priority. Tutors are reviewed prior to meeting with any students. Students are required to sign up with a school email address.

            <h2>Real feedback.</h2>
            <p>
                Tutors can be reviewed after they've helped you out. Receiving constant feedback from students ensures the integrity of the barter system.
